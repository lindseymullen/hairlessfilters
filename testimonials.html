            Pros of Using Hair Less Filters
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hair doesn't normally stick to filters, if it does a quick brush with your fingers will remove it!</li>
            <li>Clean the Hair Less filter once a week with a damp cloth without ever removing it from the blower.</li>
            <li>Deep clean every 6 months by taking the Hair Less filter off and running it under water. This takes
                around 10 minutes and soap should never be used.
            </li>
            <li>Most groomers say they have not replaced the filters that come with their blower or cleaned them since
                installing the Hair Less Filter.
            </li>
            <li>Groomers using Hair Less Filters with their Shop-Vacs all say "Wow", no more daily cleaning of the
                pleats!
            </li>
            <li>The Shop-Vac filters normally last 18 months but with the Hair Less Filters they last at least 6 years!
            </li>
            <li>The equipment that have Hair Less Filters installd have better air flow, run cooler, and go longer
                between repairs.
            </li>

                    I purchased my first filter in 2017 for a K-9 blower. Shortly after, placed orders for all
                    my blowers, then my shop vac, then my dehumidifier and recently, several of their new
                    aprons. All work as described. Recently replaced some of the original filters as the filter
                    material wore out. The Hair Less Filter products have reduced my maintenance costs and make
                    my groomers happy. We have been noticing that the shop is cleaner and has less dander and
                    dust flowing around the grooming area. I will never again operate without Hair Less Filters
                    on my equipment.

                    I was working at a grooming shop in Tucson when they started using Hair Less Filter
                    products on their blowers and shop vac units. All of the groomers were impressed on how
                    they improved working conditions. I have recently purchased this grooming facility and
                    just added thier return air filters on all return air ducts in the building. I am in the
                    process of starting up two additional grooming facilities in the area. They will have
                    Hair Less Filters on all blowers, shop vac units and return air ducts in the building.

                    I have been using Hair Less Filters on my blowers and shop vac units for several years.
                    I like them because at the end of the day I can with a quick glance know if the
                    equipment is clean and ready for use the next morning. I have been working with Hair
                    Less Filter for a couple of years to develop a filter that works on a Grissley cage
                    blower. This year, Hair Less Filter has developed a successful filter that eliminates
                    hair plugging the blower cage and reduces drying times. I am now using the very first
                    successful filter and a second has been delivered and is being installed on a second
                    Grissley blower. I will always keep their filters on my equipment for reduced
                    maintenance and ease of keeping the equipment clean and free from hair.

                    I absolutely LOVE my apron! Even with smocks I always get hair splinters from hand strip
                    breeds and other wire coated dogs but now with the apron I don't! It's completely hair resistant
                    and waterproof which saves my clothes from getting soaked and covered with hair! I now own 3 of
                    these aprons and take them with me whenever I'm grooming or bathing a dog! Best apron ever!
